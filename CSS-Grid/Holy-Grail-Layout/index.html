          At least 67 Palestinian children killed in Gaza since ‘ceasefire’
          began: UN

        <p>
          At least 67 Palestinian children have been killed in the Gaza Strip
          since a United States-brokered ceasefire agreement came into effect
          last month, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) says. Speaking
          during a news conference in Geneva on Friday, UNICEF spokesperson
          Ricardo Pires said the death toll includes a baby girl who was killed
          in an Israeli air strike on a home in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis on
          Thursday.

          It also includes seven other children killed a day earlier, as Israel
          carried out a wave of attacks across the enclave. “This is during an
          agreed ceasefire. The pattern is staggering,” Pires told reporters of
          the death toll since October 11, the first full day of the truce
          between Israel and Hamas. “As we have repeated many times, these are
          not statistics: Each was a child with a family, a dream, a life –
          suddenly cut short by continued violence.” Palestinian children have
          borne the brunt of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, with UNICEF
          estimating last month that 64,000 children have been killed and
          injured in Israeli attacks since the war began in October 2023. Save
          the Children reported this week that, in 2024, an average of 475
          Palestinian children “suffered lifelong disabilities” each month as a
          result of the war, including traumatic brain injuries and burns. Gaza
          has also become “home to the largest cohort of child amputees in
          modern history”, the humanitarian group said.
