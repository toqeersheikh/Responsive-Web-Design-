          <h3>History of Lahore</h3>
          <p>
            Lahore is the second-largest city of Pakistan and has a rich and
            diverse history spanning thousands of years. The first recorded
            mention of the city can be found in the 982 AD ‘Hudud-i-Alam’ where
            Lahore is mentioned as a small city with large temples, markets and
            orchards.

          <h3>What Lahore has to offer</h3>
          <p>
            Much of the Mughal Empire influence to this day stands strong in
            Lahore. It was during this time period that Lahore was at the
            pinnacle of its architectural glory, starting with the rule of the
            first Mughal Emperor Babur in 1524, right up until 1752 when Mughal
            rule finally came to an end.

          <h3>Let’s explore Art & Culture</h3>
          <p>
            With Punjab being home to many of Pakistan’s Sufis, saints, and
            mystics, a love for art, poetry, architecture and music also flows
            along the intricate folds of Lahore’s culture. Myriad festivals and
            events take place here often and include concerts, art exhibitions
            and literature festivals especially during the cooler months of the
            year.
